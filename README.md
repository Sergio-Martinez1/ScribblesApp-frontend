## Before you getting started
You'll need to configure the "Scribbles Api" to see the full functionality of the application.
- Go to the api repository https://github.com/Sergio-Martinez1/ScribblesApp-Api

```
scribblesapp
|-- ScribblesApp-api
|-- db
```
When already configure your db and api, continue with the frontend configuration.

```
cd scribblesapp

```
git clone https://github.com/Sergio-Martinez1/ScribblesApp-frontend.git && cd ScribblesApp-frontend
```

```
API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080
